#### Anon 2021. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Makes Onions Larger, More Nutritious and More Pleasant Tasting! [online] *CO2 Science*. Available at: http://www.co2science.org/articles/V21/mar/a15.php [Accessed 16 Oct. 2021].
The argument being made in this article is that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels benefit onions, by increasing and improving their size, nutrition value, and taste.  This article reviews a paper titled “The interaction between mycorrhizal inoculation, humic acids supply and elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increases energetic and antioxidant properties and sweetness of yellow onion”, published in an official Korean journal for Horticultural Science (Bettoni et al., 2017).  In the article, they summarize main points of this paper, including the effect on yellow onions of three growth influencing variables, agronomic effect (with and without humic acid), environmental factors (normal or elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels), and biotic influence (with or without mycorrhizal fungi).  Their findings demonstrated that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> had the most positive effect on examined variables such as an increase of photosynthetic activity.  The findings of this article are relevant to farmers as well as consumers, as an all-around improvement in produce would benefit all parties.<br />
<br />
The article cites two papers in their article, one (mentioned previously) and another cited following a claim related to health and medicinal properties of onions.  Said paper is titled “Comparison of Phenolic Content and Antioxidant Capacity of Red and Yellow Onions” and published in a Czech Journal and can be accessed in a Czech Journal of Food Sciences (Cheng et al., 2013).  Both cited papers were published in official journals which demonstrates reliability in that they were reviewed and accepted into the journal.  Specific to the Korean journal, the dates of receival, revision, and acceptance to the journal are easily accessible, as well as its publication on the site Springer Link, a well-known publishing platform (N.A., 2021).<br />
<br />
Regarding the article itself, there are several factors that can be used to assess the credibility of the information being presented to support the claims they are making.  First and foremost, the data that is presented in the article does not exist in the paper they are reviewing in any capacity, meaning that this data was created for the purpose of this article.  For example, it is stated that bulb concentrations of starch increase from 10 to 146%, however, in the Korean journal paper, bulb concentration not only has fictional percentages, but is not mentioned in the paper.  Furthermore, it was stated that total soluble sugars were increased from 48 to 67%, total soluble proteins from 86 to 293%, and soluble phenolics from 7 to 30%.  When observing this data within the article, a reader would see this as a positive increase and one which significantly supports the claim they are making, though simple investigation demonstrates that this data was made up. Furthermore, several issues arise when reviewing the figure utilized in this article.  Firstly, made up data was utilized in its creation, as well as a random unit of measurement (seen below on the y-axis), which was not found in the data or figures of the original paper.  Following their figure caption, they cite the paper as the source of it, as if to show readers that the figure was included in this reviewed and accepted paper.<br />

(As seen in the article) <br />
**Figure 1.** Onion bulb dry matter response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment under various growth conditions, including with or without humic acids (HA) and mycorrhizal fungi inoculation. Legend: aCO2 = ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 360 ppm, eCO2 = elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 700 ppm. Source: Bettoni et al. (2017).<br />
<br />
This false data and homemade figure are rather interesting inclusions, as the findings of the paper supported aspects of the articles claims without the fictitious data, as it is stated that “the perception of sweetness” and overall pleasantness of onions for consumption may be enhanced, though in the case of the paper, they are referring to context in which there is a triple interaction of the three growth influencing variables. Therefore, there was little need for them to falsify information had they properly provided a summary and reflection with what was already presented in the paper.  One final factor that can be easily noticed is the two twitter hyperlink bubbles that if clicked on either follows their twitter account, or create a pre-made tweet including the article title, link, and their twitter handle.  Overall there are numerous factors that diminish the reliability of this article and the publishing site itself, that unfortunately have the ability to be overlooked by those hoping to find support for their climate denying claims.
